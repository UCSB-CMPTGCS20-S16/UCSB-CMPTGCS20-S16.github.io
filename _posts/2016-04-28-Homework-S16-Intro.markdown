For various reasons, I'm experimenting with a new way of publishing homework assignments to the web.  (See more on my reasons, below.)

H00 is still on the old Mediawiki site for now, but if all goes well, H01 and future homeworks will be published here.


* H00: as [html](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/8wiki/index.php/S16:Homework:H00), and as [pdf](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs20/16S/pdf/cs20-S16-H00.pdf)


Reasons I'm switching
---------------------

I used to use the same software that is used for Wikipedia (called "Mediawiki"), but it is turning out to be a bit of a software maintenance burden.   It's also harder to share materials with other instructors.  My hope is that using something based on github will make that easier.   This platform, Jekyll, can be run on github.com's infrastructure at no cost (for public sites), or run on our own infrastructure.    It uses git for version control.   The syntax is straightforward (unlike hand coded HTML.)
